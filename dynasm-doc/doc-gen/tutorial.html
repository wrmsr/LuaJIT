      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The starting point of this tutorial is the following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfsck">brainfsck</a> interpreter:</p>
        <pre class="listing">bf_c</pre>
        <p>Over the course of this tutorial, we'll use DynASM to transform this interpreter
           into a brainfsck JIT compiler, therein hopefully making it faster.</p>
        <p>To follow along, clone this repository and start from <code>bf_c.c</code>:</p>
        <pre>$ git clone GITHUB_CLONE_URL
$ cd dynasm-doc
$ git submodule update --init
$ cp bf_c.c tutorial.c</pre>
        <p>The functionality of the starting point can be checked by running the following,
           which should very slowly render the Mandelbrot set:</p>
        <pre>$ gcc -o tutorial tutorial.c
$ ./tutorial mandelbrot.bf</pre>

      <h2 id="groundwork">Groundwork</h2>
        <p>Before the real fun can begin, we need to lay a few pieces of groundwork.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="includes">Includes</h3>
        <p>First of all, we need to <code>#include</code> the DynASM headers:</p>
        <pre class="diff">+dynasm_includes</pre>
        <p>As described in more detail on the reference page, <code>dasm_proto.h</code>
           defines the DynASM API, and <code>dasm_x86.h</code> contains the implementation
           of said API (for x86 / x64).</p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="types">Types</h3>
        <p>Next, we'll rename <code>bf_interpret</code> to <code>bf_compile</code> and change
           its type signature:</p>
        <pre class="diff">-bf_interpret_decl
+bf_compile_decl</pre>
        <p>Where previously <code>bf_interpret</code> accepted both a <code>const&nbsp;char*</code>
           and a <code>bf_state_t*</code>, <code>bf_compile</code> now accepts just the
           <code>const&nbsp;char*</code> portion, and will return a function pointer to the JIT-compiled
           code.</p>
        <p>The code which calls <code>bf_interpret</code> also needs updating at this point:</p>
        <pre class="diff">-call_bf_interpret
+call_bf_compile</pre>
      <hr>
      <h2 id="initialisation">Initialisation</h2>
        <p>With the groundwork done, the next task is creating and initialising a DynASM state.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>
        <p>We'll need a variable of type <code>dasm_State*</code> to contain the DynASM state, and
           two extra variables whose purpose will be explained later. We can also get rid of an
           interpreter variable at the same time:</p>
         <pre class="diff">-bf_interpret_vars
+bf_compile_vars</pre>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="arch">.arch</h3>
        <p>We now reach the first of many DynASM directives, which are instructions to the DymASM
           preprocessor. In this case, we need to instruct it as to which architecture we're
           generating machine code for, which will either be x86 or x64:</p>
        <pre class="diff">+arch</pre>
        <p>Lines starting with a vertical bar will be picked up by the DynASM preprocessor. The
           <code>.if</code>, <code>.else</code>, and <code>.endif</code> directives will be handled
           by DynASM's prepreprocessor, with semantics similar to C's preprocessor <code>#if</code>,
           <code>#else</code>, and <code>#endif</code>. As a result, exactly one <code>.arch</code>
           directive will take effect.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="dasm_init">dasm_init</h3>
        <p>Having declared a variable of type <code>dasm_State*</code>, we need to actually
           allocate a <code>dasm_State</code> to put in it, which is done by calling <code>dasm_init</code>:</p>
        <pre class="diff">+dasm_init</pre>
        <p>Note that as well as a <code>dasm_State**</code>, <code>dasm_init</code> also requires
           an integer argument, which specifies the number of sections of machine code that'll be
           generated. We only need one code section, so we invoke the <code>.section</code> directive
           with one argument, which the DynASM preprocessor will rewrite to <code>#define&nbsp;DASM_MAXSECTION&nbsp;1</code>
           (amongst other things). This is a slightly convoluted way of passing <code>1</code> as the
           second argument to <code>dasm_init</code>, but is a good habit in case we need more sections
           in the future.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="dasm_setupglobal">dasm_setupglobal</h3>
        <p><code>dasm_init</code> will have allocated a <code>dasm_State</code>, but won't have fully
           initialised it. A few more calls are required to fully initialise the state, the first of
           which is <code>dasm_setupglobal</code>:</p>
        <pre class="diff">+dasm_setupglobal</pre>
        <p>The <code>.globals</code> directive with the argument <code>lbl_</code> will be rewritten by the
           DynASM preprocessor to become an <code>enum</code> containing several things, one of which will
           be <code>lbl__MAX</code>. This value must be passed to <code>dasm_setupglobal</code>, along with
           an array of <code>void*</code> of equal extent. We'll make use of this <code>labels</code> array
           much later.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="dasm_setup">dasm_setup</h3>
        <p>The next call in the initialisation sequence is to <code>dasm_setup</code>:</p>
        <pre class="diff">+dasm_setup</pre>
        <p>The <code>.actionlist</code> directive with the argument <code>bf_actions</code> will be rewritten
           by the DynASM preprocessor to become a variable called <code>bf_actions</code>, and this variable
           must be passed to <code>dasm_setup</code>.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="dasm_growpc">dasm_growpc</h3>
        <p>For a lot of use cases, the <code>dasm_State</code> would be fully initialised at this point.
           However, as we'll be making use of dynamic labels, there is one more initialisation call to
           make, which is to <code>dasm_growpc</code>:</p>
        <pre class="diff">+dasm_growpc</pre>
        <p>We're passing <code>npc</code> as an argument, which is a variable we declared earlier. Said
           variable represents the number of dynamic labels we've allocated, while the related variable
           <code>nextpc</code> represents the number of dynamic labels we've used. These dynamic labels
           will come into play when compiling <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2 id="abstractions">Abstractions</h2>
        <p>Before we start emitting machine code, it is useful to define a few abstractions. The first
           few abstractions are to give slightly more meaningful names to the registers we'll be using:</p>
        <table class="table table-striped">
        <thead><tr><th>Abstraction</th><th>Corresponding Interpreter Variable</th><th>Definition</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td><code>aState</code></td><td><code>state</code></td><td><code>ebx</code> or <code>rbx</code></td></tr>
          <tr><td><code>aPtr</code></td><td><code>ptr</code></td><td><code>ebp</code> or <code>r12</code></td></tr>
          <tr><td><code>aTapeBegin</code></td><td><code>tape_begin</code></td><td><code>esi</code> or <code>rsi</code> or <code>r13</code></td></tr>
          <tr><td><code>aTapeEnd</code></td><td><code>tape_end</code></td><td><code>edi</code> or <code>rdi</code> or <code>r14</code></td></tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>The next group of useful abstractions relate to function calls:</p>
        <table class="table table-striped">
        <thead><tr><th>Abstraction</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td><code>prologue</code></td><td>Set up the stack frame, and set <code>aState</code> from the passed parameter.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><code>prepcall1 arg1</code></td><td>Prepare to call a function with one argument, <code>arg1</code>.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><code>prepcall2 arg1, arg2</code></td><td>Prepare to call a function with two arguments, <code>arg1</code> and <code>arg2</code>.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><code>postcall n</code></td><td>Do cleanup after a call to a function with <code>n</code> arguments.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><code>epilogue</code></td><td>Tear down the stack frame.</td></tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>All of these abstractions are defined by means of <code>.define</code> (for simple substitutions) or <code>.macro</code> (for more
           complex constructions), and have different definitions for each of x86, x64 POSIX, and x64 Windows:</p>
        <pre class="diff">+arch_defines</pre>
        <p>Having made all of these architecture and operating system dependent definitions for the DynASM preprocessor, it
           is useful to check that the architecture and operating system specified to the DynASM preprocessor match the architecture
           and operating system as known by the C preprocessor, which is done by the following:</p>
        <pre class="diff">+preproc_consistency</pre>
        <p>Note the line starting with two vertical bars: such lines undergo <code>.define</code> substitution by the DynASM
           prepreprocessor (and can particicpate in <code>.macro</code> definitions), but are otherwise unchanged by the DynASM
           preprocessor. In particular, if <code>X64</code> and/or <code>WIN</code> are defined (to <code>1</code>) at DynASM prepreprocessing time,
           then they'll be substituted for <code>1</code>. If they're not defined at DynASM prepreprocessing time, they'll be
           left unchanged, and be substituated for <code>0</code> by the C preprocessor.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2 id="emitting">Emitting Code</h2>
        <p>With all of that done, we're finally ready to emit some machine code.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="prologue">Prologue</h3>
        <p>The first thing we need to emit is a prologue, which replaces some of the initialisation previously done by the interpreter:</p>
        <pre class="diff">-bf_interpret_state_init
+bf_compile_state_init</pre>
        <p>The first item of interest here is the <code>.type</code> directive, which subsequently allows us to write <code>state-&gt;tape</code>
           as a shorthand for <code>[aState + offsetof(bf_state_t,tape)]</code>.</p>
        <p>The next line defines a variable called <code>Dst</code>, and initialises it to <code>&amp;d</code>. This is done because the
           DynASM preprocessor will rewrite the subsequent lines to calls of the form <code>dasm_put(Dst, ...)</code>, and like the
           previous calls we've made to <code>dasm_</code> functions, the first argument wants to be <code>&amp;d</code>.</p>
        <p>The next line contains a <code class="nolink">.code</code> directive. Said directive was introduced by the prior <code>.section code</code>
           directive, and states that subsequently emitted machine code should be placed in the <code>code</code> section (which happens
           to be the one and only section we're working with).</p>
        <p>After this, we define the global label <code>-&gt;bf_main</code>. After we've finished emitting machine code, we'll
           obtain the address of this global label and turn it into a function pointer.</p>
        <p>We then invoke the <code>prologue</code> macro as defined earlier, which will cause a few instructions to be emitted.</p>
        <p>Finally, we have a <code>mov</code> instruction and two <code>lea</code> instructions, which directly correspond to the
           removed interpreter code. As mentioned, the <code>state-&gt;tape</code> specified as an operand to <code>mov</code> is
           recognised as shorthand for <code>[aState + offsetof(bf_state_t,tape)]</code>. Note that both <code>offsetof(bf_state_t,tape)</code>
           and <code>TAPE_SIZE-1</code> (part of the <code>lea</code> operand) are so-called encoding-time constants: DynASM doesn't
           understand what they mean, so it defers their computation to the C compiler. Both of these values happen to be compile-time
           constants in C, but encoding-time constants don't have to be compile-time constants (we'll see examples of this in just a minute).</p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="tape-movement">Tape Movement</h3>
        <p>We've reached the guts of the interpreter now, and the first job is to replace the interpreter's handling of <code>&lt;</code> with
           the compiler's interpretation:</p>
        <pre class="diff">-bf_interpret_prev
+bf_compile_prev</pre>
        <p>Note that the compiler doesn't have a notion of skipping over code like the interpreter does, so the outer <code>if</code> is
           dropped entirely. After that, <code>ptr -= n;</code> and some iterations of the subsequent loop have become <code>| sub aPtr, n%TAPE_SIZE</code>.
           Note that <code>n%TAPE_SIZE</code> is an encoding-time constant which isn't a compile-time constant in C: DynASM still doesn't
           understand what the operand means, but in this case the final value of the operand is computed when <code>bf_compile</code> is running.</p>
        <p>After performing some iterations of the loop at compile time by means of <code>%TAPE_SIZE</code>, there might still be one iteration
           to perform at runtime, which correspond to the <code>cmp</code>, <code>ja</code>, and <code>add</code> instructions. Note that
           the syntax <code>&gt;1</code> jumps forward to the next definition of the local label <code>1</code>, which is just after the <code>add</code>
           instruction.</p>
        <p>A similar transformation happens for <code>&gt;</code>, but with <code>add</code> and <code>sub</code> transposed:</p>
        <pre class="diff">-bf_interpret_next
+bf_compile_next</pre>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="arithmetic">Arithmetic</h3>
        <p>The next instruction to be rewritten is <code>+</code>, which is relatively simple:</p>
        <pre class="diff">-bf_interpret_inc
+bf_compile_inc</pre>
        <p>The only notable thing is the presence of the memory size specifier <code>byte</code> before the memory operand <code>[aPtr]</code>. As neither
           the memory operand nor the immediate operand have a natural operand size, DynASM needs to be explicitly told. Note that our prior uses of
           memory operands didn't require memory size specifiers: <code>lea</code> instructions don't require them because the memory operands aren't memory
           accesses, and <code>mov aPtr, state-&gt;tape</code> didn't require one because the size of the memory operand was inferred to be equal to size of
           the register operand.</p>
        <p>The handling of <code>-</code> is similar:</p>
        <pre class="diff">-bf_interpret_dec
+bf_compile_dec</pre>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="io">I/O</h3>
        <p>The next job involves the logic for <code>,</code> (read char) and <code>.</code> (write char), which are notable because they involve
           calling other functions. The first of these is <code>,</code>:</p>
        <pre class="diff">-bf_interpret_get
+bf_compile_get</pre>
        <p>Note the invocations of the <code>prepcall1</code> and <code>postcall</code> abstractions that we defined earlier. Also note that
           <code>state-&gt;get_ch</code> is shorthand for <code>[aState + offsetof(bf_state_t,get_ch)]</code> courtesy of the earlier <code>.type</code>
           directive, and that memory size specifiers are still required when these shorthands are used: the size of the memory operand will
           not be automatically inferred to be equal to the size of the named C structure member. The <code>aword</code> (address-sized word)
           specifier refers to either 4 bytes <span class="badge">x86</span> or 8 bytes <span class="badge">x64</span>.</p>
        <p>The transformation of <code>.</code> is similar:</p>
        <pre class="diff">-bf_interpret_put
+bf_compile_put</pre>
        <p>Note that <code>r0</code> is used as a register operand: it refers to either <code>eax</code> <span class="badge">x86</span> or <code>rax</code> <span class="badge">x64</span>.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>
        <p>We now reach the really interesting instructions: <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>. The first of these has a rather complex transformation:</p>
        <pre class="diff">-bf_interpret_bra
+bf_compile_bra</pre>
        <p>First of all, we now recognise the instruction sequence <code>[-]</code> and emit optimised machine code for it. Having excluded this specific case, the
           general case requires two dynamic labels: one for jumping from <code>[</code> to after <code>]</code> (previously done by means of the <code>nskip</code>
           variable in the interpreter), and one for jumping from <code>]</code> to after <code>[</code> (previously done by means of the <code>loops</code> stack).</p>
        <p>If the number of dynamic labels we've used equals the number we've allocated, then we call <code>dasm_growpc</code> in order to allocate some more. We then
           emit a <code>cmp</code> instruction, which does the obvious thing. If the byte at <code>[aPtr]</code> was zero, we jump to the dynamic label <code>=&gt;nextpc+1</code>
           (which we'll subsequently define when we see <code>]</code>). After this, we define the dynamic label <code>=&gt;nextpc</code> (which is what <code>]</code> will
           jump back to). Note that both <code>nextpc+1</code> and <code>nextpc</code> are encoding-time constants.</p>
        <p>The second half of the magic comes from the handling of <code>]</code>:</p>
        <pre class="diff">-bf_interpret_ket
+bf_compile_ket</pre>
        <p>Note the conditional jump to the dynamic label <code>=&gt;loops[nloops]</code> (which jumps to the <code>=&gt;nextpc</code> defined by the corresponding <code>[</code>),
           and the definition of the dynamic label <code>=&gt;loops[nloops]+1</code> (which is jumped to by <code>jz =&gt;nextpc+1</code> emitted by the corresponding <code>[</code>).</p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h3>
        <p>Having covered all of the instructions, all that is left is handling the epilogue and extracting a function pointer from DynASM:</p>
        <pre class="diff">-bf_interpret_finish
+bf_compile_finish</pre>
        <p>The first of these lines invokes the <code>epilogue</code> macro we defined earlier. The next line calls out to <code>link_and_encode</code>, which
           is a function we'll define in just a minute. We then call <code>dasm_free</code>, which frees the DynASM state. Finally, we take the <code>labels</code>
           array we previously defined and passed to <code>dasm_setupglobal</code>, index it with <code>lbl_bf_main</code> (which was defined by <code>.globals lbl_</code> and corresponds
           to the global label <code>-&gt;bf_main</code>), and cast it to a function pointer.</p>
        <p>The <code>link_and_encode</code> function is defined as follows:</p>
        <pre class="diff">+link_and_encode</pre>
        <p>The particularly interesting calls are to <code>dasm_link</code> and <code>dasm_encode</code>. The remaining calls use operating system functionality
           to allocate a block of read-write memory and then convert said block to read-execute. Note that we could have allocated a block of read-write-execute
           memory, but it is generally considered bad form to have memory which is writable and executable at the same time.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2 id="compiling">Compiling</h2>
        <p>If you've been following along, your <code>tutorial.c</code> should now correspond to the following:</p>
        <pre class="listing">bf_dynasm</pre>
        <p>If you've not been following that closely, you can reach the same state by doing:</p>
        <pre>$ git clone GITHUB_CLONE_URL
$ cd dynasm-doc
$ git submodule update --init
$ cp bf_dynasm.c tutorial.c</pre>
        <p>In order to compile <code>tutorial.c</code>, we first need to run it through the DynASM preprocessor. Said preprocessor is written in Lua, so we'll
           first compile a minimal Lua interpreter:</p>
        <pre>$ gcc -o minilua luajit-2.0/src/host/minilua.c</pre>
        <p>With this interpreter in place, we can run the DynASM preprocessor:</p>
        <pre>$ ./minilua luajit-2.0/dynasm/dynasm.lua -o tutorial.posix64.c -D X64 tutorial.c</pre>
        <p>With preprocessing done, we can now invoke a C compiler:</p>
        <pre>$ gcc -o tutorial tutorial.posix64.c</pre>
        <p>We can then run the resulting executable, which should fairly quickly render the Mandelbrot set:</p>
        <pre>$ ./tutorial mandelbrot.bf</pre>
